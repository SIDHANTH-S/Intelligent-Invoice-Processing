The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

## How can I deploy this project?

Use your preferred deployment method (Vercel, Netlify, or self-host) â€” build with `npm run build` and deploy the `dist` folder.

To connect a custom domain, follow your chosen provider's instructions.

## Supabase integration

This project can connect to a Supabase project. Create a file called `.env.local` at the repository root and add the following variables (do NOT commit this file):

VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://<your-project>.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="<your-publishable-key>"

If you need the project id for reference you can set it too (not required by the client lib):
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="<project-id>"

After adding the variables, install the Supabase client and run the dev server:

1. npm install @supabase/supabase-js
2. npm run dev

The app will attempt to read from the tables: `customers`, `products`, `bills`, `expenses`, and `bill_items`. If Supabase is not configured the app falls back to local mock data.
